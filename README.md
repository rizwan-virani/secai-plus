## What this is

An academic preparation resource that tests your knowledge **dynamically** with original, randomized questions and hands-on simulators. It is a comprehensive study portal that covers every objective in the official CY0-001 exam outline, and it is completely free, self-paced, and offline-capable once loaded.

## What this is not

- **Not** a source of actual or copyrighted CompTIA exam questions, "brain dumps," or leaked items. **Every question in this repository is original.**
- **Not** an official CompTIA product, and not affiliated with, endorsed by, or sponsored by CompTIA.
- **Not** a guarantee of a passing score. It is a practice tool — the exam tests judgment, not memorization.

## Features

| Area | What you get |
| --- | --- |
| **Domain study modules** | 4 rigorous reading interfaces, one per exam domain, with deep technical definitions, comparison tables, exam tips, and real-world scenarios. **54 sections** mapped to the official CY0-001 outline, lazy-loaded per domain. |
| **Rapid Recall flashcards** | **400 cards** with a **Leitner spaced-repetition** scheduler, per-domain decks, a Master Acronym Drill, and an All Due Today review. |
| **Practice quizzes** | A bank of **400 original questions**, each graded with a full rationale that explains the correct answer **and why every individual distractor is wrong**. Domain, quick, adaptive, and missed-question modes. |
| **PBQ simulators** | **30 performance-based questions** across 5 formats, plus a drag-and-drop **Technical Taxonomy Mapping** engine (7 classification activities). |
| **Hands-on labs** | **20 interactive sandbox labs** with a full-screen console, dropdown configuration, a live command terminal, and a progress log. |
| **Mock exam** | A full-length, timed simulation weighted to the official domain percentages, with a countdown timer, flagging, and a domain-by-domain scoring dashboard. |
| **Supplemental hub** | An Industry Certification Explorer and a curated external-resources library. |
| **Theme** | A global light/dark toggle with all state saved to your browser. |

## How to use it

1. **Read the Exam Mechanics & Career Guidance cards first** to understand scoring, timing, and question styles.
2. **Deep-dive the Domain Study cards** — one rigorous reading interface per domain.
3. **Lock in terms with Rapid Recall Flashcards**, graded on a spaced-repetition scheduler.
4. **Validate with the Domain Quizzes**, drawn at random and graded with full rationale.
5. **Train practical skills in the PBQ Simulators** and the Technical Taxonomy Mapping engine.
6. **Get hands-on in the Labs** — flip a card to review objectives, then launch the sandbox console.
7. **Benchmark readiness with the full-length, timed Mock Exam.**

## Run it locally

The site is fully static — no build step. Serve the folder with any static web server:

```bash
# from the repository root:
python -m http.server 8107
# then open http://localhost:8107
```

Best experienced on a desktop or laptop in Google Chrome; the labs, terminal simulations, and drag-and-drop activities require a mouse and keyboard.
